- I prefer to use it in Microsoft Word because it gives me access to other tools like Zotero and other referencing managers that I happen to use in Word.
- It's really really useful if you're in the pointy end of submission.
- It's just a little bit too distracting to get all of the information out of your brain and then start refining it.
- Revolutionize to revolutionize um and solar energy is harness instead of we harness energy I'll accept that.
- This is not just for writing now the co-pilot opens up the door to getting academic sort of advice.
- It's generally a little bit too lackluster because it doesn't know the ins and outs of Academia but it does give you a great place to start thinking about how to approach the issues you're having.
- The literature provides a limited perspective on the application of solution process methods for the manufacturer that's fine yeah okay fine it just makes it a little bit more boring I think.
- Addressing the degradation mechanisms yeah I like that I like that.
- The one thing I like about this generate thing is it is all of the little boring stuff that quite often just sucks up loads of your time for no reason.
- This is kind of a cool little thing so I've done outlines let's say that I actually want a title for this paper I don't really know what it is at the moment.
- All of these things quite often just take up so much time now they're just at the click of a button.
- Overall we've got a similarity of 11% which is fantastic so that tells me that yeah this is uh suitable for publishing and submission to a journal.
- This is what I really like here this is where it tells you um all of the things things that it thinks you should change.
- I put in this paper because it was already in the format that the journal article wanted it in and you can see it navigated the columns really well and it's given me loads of suggestions on the different spelling and grammatical changes it would make but it also has comments.
